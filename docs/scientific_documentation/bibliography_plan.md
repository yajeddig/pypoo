## Next Steps

1. **Literature Search:**  
   - Gather and review key papers and books on ASM models, ADM1, and other reaction models.
   - Search for state-of-the-art flowsheet simulation methodologies and numerical solvers used in process systems engineering.
2. **Bibliography Organization:**  
   - Create a reference manager library (using tools like Zotero or Mendeley) to keep track of sources.
   - Organize references by category: Reaction Models, Unit Operations, Flowsheet Algorithms, and Utilities.
3. **Gap Analysis:**  
   - Identify areas where literature is lacking or where models need further development.
   - Outline any potential modifications or extensions needed for your specific PyPoo framework.
4. **Document Findings:**  
   - Summarize the research in a living document or report that can be updated as new literature is found.
